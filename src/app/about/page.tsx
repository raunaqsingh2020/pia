                                I&apos;ve reported on toxic workplace environments and alleged corruption at a multimillion-dollar biotech operation housed in an Ivy League university; AI-enabled military technology; crypto&apos;s true believers; long-term investing trends across health care and energy industries; the history of racial injustice in Philadelphia; the deaths of college peers; local voter turnout and live election polling; a renewed labor movement driven by local unions; as well as the lingering emotional and financial toll of the Covid-19 pandemic.

                                During my time at Penn, I was the Executive Editor of The Daily Pennsylvanian, Inc., where I managed 250+ student managers and professional staff members of the company and oversaw the digital and print editorial coverage of the company&apos;s 3 publications: The Daily Pennsylvanian, 34th Street Magazine, and Under the Button. I led the newsroom through a vital period of digital and internal transformation with an eye towards sustaining its daily operations, maintaining and repurposing its extensive budget, focusing on diversity, inclusion and retention efforts, as well as transforming the company&apos;s long-term content production, product innovation, and financial initiatives. I was also on the board of Penn&apos;s premier fashion and culture publication, The WALK Magazine, as its lead videographer and team director.

I explore identity through a multimedia process, seeking to illustrate the beauty of human subconscious and physicality through undertones of culture, power, and romance.
